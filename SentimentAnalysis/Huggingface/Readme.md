# Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis pipeline using the Hugging Face Transformers library in a Google Colab environment. The code allows you to upload a text file, process the contents to analyze the sentiment of each sentence, and output the results.

## Overview

The main steps involved in the code are:
1. Installing necessary libraries.
2. Initializing a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
3. Uploading a text file via Google Colab.
4. Processing the file to extract sentences.
5. Analyzing the sentiment of each sentence.
6. Displaying the sentiment and confidence score for each sentence.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (recommended environment) (https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PyTorch

## Sample Data

The repo comes with a sample dataset that you can use to test the sentiment analysis.
